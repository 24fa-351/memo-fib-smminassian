Program Expectations
fib(1) = 0
fib(2) = 1
fib(3) = 1
fib(4) = 2

So 
Because we subtract 1 in main 
fibonachiRecurs(0) = 0
fibonachiRecurs(1) = 1
fibonachiRecurs(2) = 1
fibonachiRecurs(3) = 2
fibArray[1] = 1
fib

So heres the deal. I need to review the lectures before class. Why? Because professor told me so. Moreover, he would have not have mentioned 
that I need to watch the lectures if i did watch the lectures. But because i didn't do it, thats why he told me to do it. 

So the incentive of watching the videos is to make sure that I can understand whats going on during class. Not only that it is also to have
background knowledge when I ask questions. Cus why I ask questions when if I dont review the material. 

Also he said to ask him questions when I am lost. He wants me to ask incentive questions and this makes sense cus he wants
his students to succeed in the class. So with that said, I will not be scared to ask questions and I willl do my prep before the class. 
The reason why is because if I can answer my questions on my own, then that is a new level of mastery.

Ok now lets go into the code. Why write this program? I write it to understand Memoization. What is Memoization? It is when you store
previously computed values in a cache and once those computed values are computed again, we just return the value that is stored in the cache. 
So really we only do one function call and that function call is the new number we try to find.
